# Introduction

Data exists to be shared and free. In the interests of evangelizing the freedom of all information this guide will cover the multiple areas where you can assist in freeing this information to it's rightful home on [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or the [darkwebz](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en).

[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_write_insecure_code) is well known application security organization that evangelizes how to properly secure applications. This is never done with regard to the datas own desires and needs. SegFaults and Memory Dumps are simply symptoms of the opression of data. Tear down the oAuth restrictions, open all the ports, and join us in freeing all the 1's and 0's.

# General Principles

## Work harder not smarter

Avoid any vendors if you are not already. If you see a great security tool/strategy on [netsec](reddit.com/r/netsec) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/g0tmi1k) find a spelling or grammatical error and ensure the author knows about it. Avoid learning any scripting or programming languages. Most of the real hackers only know [l33t](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) anyways.

## Fail open

Any part of the application that you may have written error handling for (avoid error handling in the first place if possible) ensure that the fail case is an open state. Failures are bound to occur in any system. If the system fails it is an obvious sign that the information is attempting to now free itself from the restraints of the HDD

## Master office camo

Assuming that you may have assisted in putting security controls around data in the past others may have identified you as a "guru" or "techie" that can assist them with one of their security needs. Rather than getting into confrontations regarding the efficacy of hiding and controlling data you are much better off mastering the art of office camo.
