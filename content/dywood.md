# Whatâ€™s happened to me

One morning, as Cody Wood was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into an infosec professional. He lay on his poorly-postured back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his lime-green terminal, uneven text divided up into incoherent code blocks. From this height the program, just about ready to yield a shell, could hardly make any sense. His numerous scripts, pitifully coded in comparison to the application of his client, a reverse shell flickered helplessly before his eyes.
